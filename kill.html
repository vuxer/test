<p>Android, Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California in October
 2003 by Andy Rubin (co-founder of Danger),[29] Rich Miner 
(co-founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc.),[30] Nick Sears
 (once VP at T-Mobile),[31] and Chris White (headed design and
 interface development at WebTV[17]) to develop, in Rubin's words
, "smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's
 location and preferences".[17] The early intentions of the
 company were to develop an advanced operating system for
 digital cameras. Though, when it was realized that the
 market for the devices was not large enough, the company
 diverted its efforts toward producing a smartphone operating system
 that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile.[32] Despite
 the past accomplishments of the founders and early employees, Android
 Inc. operated secretly, revealing only that it was working on software
 for mobile phones.[17] That same year, Rubin ran out of money. Steve
 Perlman, a close friend of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash 
in an envelope and refused a stake in the company.[33]

In July 2005, Google acquired Android Inc. for at least $50 million, whose key employees, including Rubin, Miner and White, stayed at the company after the acquisition.[15][17] Not much was known about Android Inc. at the time, but many assumed that Google was planning to enter the mobile phone market with this move.[17] At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system. Google had lined up a series of hardware component and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation on their part.[34][35][36]

Speculation about Google's intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December 2006.[37] An earlier prototype codenamed "Sooner" had a closer resemblance to a BlackBerry phone, with no touchscreen, and a physical, QWERTY keyboard, but was later re-engineered to support a touchscreen, to compete with other announced devices such as the 2006 LG Prada and 2007 Apple iPhone.[38][39] In September 2007, InformationWeek covered an Evalueserve study reporting that Google had filed several patent applications in the area of mobile telephony.[40][41]</p>
